# ReviewProblems – C# Exercises (Activities 48–55)

This project contains my solutions for the **Review Problems** exercises (Activities 48–55).  
Each activity is built as a **separate C# console project** inside one Visual Studio / Rider solution.

The goal of this work was to review fundamental programming concepts such as:
- Console input and output
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `foreach`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Functions and return values
- Lists and collections
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes and objects)

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

Some of the code structure and examples are **based on my instructor’s templates and examples** provided in the course.  
I also used **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** to help me:
- Understand the logic behind each exercise  
- Write clear Danish comments explaining what every line does  
- Clean up and structure my code correctly  

All code has been tested and verified to match the original requirements.
